This folder contains data models for use in the demo:

- TaxBlasterDataModel.xml: 
  The exported ERwin model that we will import into RZAPIS (when it will renamed to TaxBlasterDataModel.zen) 

- TaxBlasterDataModel.zen:
  The end-state data model once we have added user defined types and added the ssn property to Person.
  
- TaxBlasterDataModel-Additions.zen:
  The file from which we will copy the user defined types that will be added to our original data model.
