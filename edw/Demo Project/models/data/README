This folder contains data models for use in the demo:

- TaxBlasterDataModel.xml: 
  The original data model, exported from ERwin, that we will import into RZAPIS (when it will renamed to TaxBlasterDataModel.zen) 

- TaxBlasterDataModel-Additions.zen:
  The file from which we will copy the user defined types that will be added to our original, imported data model.
